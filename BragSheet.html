      <h4><b>MUN</b></h4>
      <p>For the past three years I have participated in the Model UN club which has helped my public speaking immensely. This started when I was in 9th Grade and I went to Rutgers Model Congress. I was able to make several new friends as well as learn in which the ways parliamentary processes work.</p>
